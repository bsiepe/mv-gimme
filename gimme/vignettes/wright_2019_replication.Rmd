This document loads data of Wright et al. (2019) from the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/95hyr/).
As code was not available online, we then fit a GIMME model with default settings to the data, as suggested by Wright in personal communication.

# Preparation



# Load Data


# Preprocessing



# Fit Model




# Sanity Check
Compare our results with fitted results online to see if we specified the model in a similar way.
